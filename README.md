## Why this exists

Most personal websites try to _summarize_ a person.
This one is trying to **observe** one.

I don’t believe people are static objects that can be fully explained by a résumé, a tech stack, or a list of achievements. I believe we’re closer to evolving systems — influenced by code, culture, spirituality, mistakes, curiosity, and long walks where ideas suddenly connect.

This project is a digital space where those layers can coexist.

## Who I am (for now)

Based in **Blumenau, Brazil** (though I spent 8 transformative months living in Ireland).

I work with software because I like **making complex things usable**.
I stay interested because I like **asking why things exist at all**.

My background lives somewhere between:

*   Engineering and systems design.
*   Knowledge organization and teaching.
*   A constant curiosity about how humans, tools, and meaning intersect.

I enjoy structure — but only if it stays flexible.
I enjoy abstraction — but only if it still touches reality.

## What you’ll eventually find here

This repository (and the site it powers) is meant to grow into a personal operating system of sorts:

*   ✍️ Essays and notes about technology, work, identity, and learning.
*   🛠️ Projects, experiments, and half-finished ideas.
*   🎨 Visual explorations, symbols, and interface concepts.
*   🧭 Reflections on where I’ve been — and what I want to build next.

*Some things will be polished.*
*Some things will be rough.*
*That’s intentional.*

## What this is *not*

*   Not a portfolio pretending to be a person
*   Not a blog chasing engagement
*   Not a manifesto claiming certainty

This is closer to a **workbench** than a showroom.

## A note to future me (and curious visitors)

If you’re reading this later:

> You’re allowed to contradict yourself.
>
> You’re allowed to delete things that no longer feel true.
>
> You’re allowed to rebuild this entire system if it stops serving you.

**Growth beats consistency.**

## Status

🚧 **Under construction** — permanently.

If something here sparks a thought, a disagreement, or a collaboration idea, that’s already a success.
